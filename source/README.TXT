On Windows, the Visual Studio projects of Open Inventor Demos and Examples requiring Qt are
not included in the package. You must install the Qt package and use CMAKE to generate them.

Makefiles for UNIX and Visual Studio projects for Windows (.vcxproj) can be generated for
your specific platform by using CMAKE.

Instructions on how to use CMAKE with Open Inventor Demos and Examples packages can be
found on the page http://oivdoc.vsg3d.com/node/18787
